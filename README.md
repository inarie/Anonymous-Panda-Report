This repository contains files related to my master's thesis report which is based on the use of metahumans as a way to to facilitate communication and expressionism for patients who want to remain anonymous during their mental health consultations. For implementation, please visit the [Anonymous Panda](https://github.com/inarie/Anonymous-Panda) repository.

## How To Use ðŸ”§

#### Requirements

A full TeX distribution is assumed.  [Various distributions for different operating systems (Windows, Mac, \*nix) are available](http://tex.stackexchange.com/q/55437) but TeX Live is recommended.
You can [install TeX from upstream](https://tex.stackexchange.com/q/1092) (recommended; most up-to-date) or use `sudo apt-get install texlive-full` if you really want that.

#### Usage

At a command prompt, run

```bash
$ xelatex thesis.tex
```

This should result in the creation of ``thesis.pdf``
