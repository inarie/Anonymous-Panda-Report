\chapter*{Abstract}

The psychosocial effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on individuals and their families, as well as its global impact on financial security, housing, and unemployment, have had a tremendous negative effect on individualsâ€™ mental health and well-being. That is especially the case for people who already suffer from mental disorders, since social isolation makes getting appropriate mental health care even more difficult.
Digital solutions that allow people to seek treatment, such as online psychological interventions and other forms of technology-mediated therapy, have been developed to assist individuals with mental health disorders. However, people have privacy concerns about their personal data and the safety of their mental health information. This work uses cutting-edge computer graphics technology to increase anonymity while maintaining expressiveness in computer-mediated mental health interventions. Additionally, through the customization of a realistic avatar using the Unreal Engine 4 (UE4), Metahumans, and Live Link, we argue it is possible to preserve patient-therapist empathy.
