\chapter*{Abstract}

The psychosocial effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on individuals and their families and its global impact on financial security, housing, and unemployment have had a tremendous negative impact on individualsâ€™ mental health and well-being. That is especially the case for people who already suffer from mental disorders since social isolation makes getting appropriate mental health care even more difficult.

Digital solutions that allow people to seek treatment, such as online psychological interventions and other technology-mediated therapy, have been developed to assist individuals with mental health disorders. However, people have privacy concerns about their data and their mental health information safety. 

This work uses cutting-edge computer graphics technology to increase anonymity while maintaining expressiveness in computer-mediated mental health interventions. Additionally, by customizing a realistic avatar using the Unreal Engine 4 (UE4), Metahumans, and Live Link, we argue if it is possible to preserve patient-therapist empathy.
