\chapter*{Acknowledgements}

I'd like to thank Professor Dr. Pedro Campos and La√≠s Lopes, my research supervisors, for their patient guidance, enthusiastic encouragement, and helpful critiques of this research work. 

To my parents, who raised me, loved me, and gave everything they had for me. And to my grandmother, who was always there for me, loved me, and encouraged me. Without them, I would not be the person I am or be in this position. With your unwavering strength, you motivated me to strive to be the best version of myself.

To my significant other, thank you for always being there for me and giving me the best advice. When I was stressed, you made me feel at ease, and when I didn't believe in myself, you made me feel capable. You are my fortress, my strength, and my refuge.

To my rabbit, Yuki, and my dog, Jasmin, for their unwavering love and for making me realize the importance of striking a balance between school and my personal life. Thank you for being my rock when no one else was. Last but not least, I would like to thank the rest of my family and friends for their encouragement and support throughout my educational life.
