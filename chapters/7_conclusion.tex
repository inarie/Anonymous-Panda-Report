\section{Conclusion}
Even though most virtual human research focuses on simulating human behavior in order to elicit empathy from users, our research takes a different approach that use virtual humans in the mental health domain, namely, utilizing virtual humans as an alternate self while attempting to link them with mental health specialists, all while maintaining anonymity, expressionism, and realism.

Although this work demonstrates new promising ways of interacting with mental health professionals online, much more research is needed to make it a seamless experience for both the patient and the therapist. Specifically, the use of custom metahumans during appointments, the incorporation of hand tracking and the ability to perform real-time movements through the avatar, and, finally, the use of voice cloning to improve anonymity.
